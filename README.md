Really not much to see here! This project is just a small, personal portfolio site that can be viewed here: http://bradack.info

The site was developed in React with a few extra packages mixed in, styled with vanilla CSS, and served from a barebones node.js webserver. Nothing too fancy here, for better or worse.
